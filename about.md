Our project is aiming to create a “Smart Park” IoT system. Internet of Things is most suitable in systems where there are many components which are constantly interacting with one-another. We had to chose a system which would benefit the most from IoT and which would be environment-friendly, and that is why we've chosen park zones.

In addition, there was a large number of employees in our company willing to take part in the IoT Challenge from Eclipse. “The more – the merrier” we’ve thought and teamed-up to create something cool and useful.

Each park has trashcans, lawns, electrical equipment, barbecue zones, benches, paths, parking lots and so on. We have to take into account that on the one hand these elements need constant maintenance, but on the other – they provide services to the visitors of parks themselves.

Our project – is an attempt to streamline various processes in the parks for staff and to improve the quality of visitor’s pastime.

The basis for our Smart Park would be our very own IoT platform, which will provide an API for mobile applications, serve as a repository for data collected by sensors, and will provide opportunities to implement the business logic (e.g. automation of various processes and etc.). On top of this platform we want to implement several applications, which will control relevant park services. Please see the picture for more details:

Our team consists of 15 people from different areas of expertise, ranging from embedded and mobile developers to ux-designers and testers. We plan to break into micro-teams, each of which will be responsible for a certain park-service, afterwards we will integrate them all into a single system on our platform.
